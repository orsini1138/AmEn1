This is the AmuletEngine, aka AmEn1. Amulet 1 and 2 were built basically with no engine, and
in an effort to organize whatever game comes next, AmEn1 is a step towards a more organized 
gamedev process. While it's not truly an 'engine', it should offer much more diversity in gameplay
and automate or make easier many of the process that bogged down and took up much of the time and
codebase of developing Amulet 2.

game.py - test script for a playable demo of the features and gameplay developed in AmEn1
faces.py - face "drawings" for dialogue interaction and messages for that character
maps.py - map refresh functions for movement in game and the maps themselves
combatTest.py - reworking the Amulet2 combat system to something more functional and fun
